## ✅ Deployment Status: SUCCESSFUL

**Repository:** ales27pm/native-monGARS  
**Branch:** main  
**Latest Commit:** 9d0710c  
**Deployment Method:** Secure GitHub Integration with .specialenv credentials

## 📋 What Was Deployed

### 🎯 Core PhiOnDevice Patches Applied

1. **TypeScript Interface Fixes** ✅
   - Added `modelName`, `version`, `memoryUsage` to `Phi4ModelInfo`
   - Enhanced `Phi4PerformanceMetrics` with `totalGenerations`, `tokensPerSecond`, `successRate`
   - Added EventEmitter compatibility (`addListener?`, `removeListeners?`) to TurboModule spec

2. **Native iOS Core ML Bridge** ✅
   - `ios/Phi4MiniRunner.swift` - Core ML model execution engine
   - `ios/RCTPhiModel.h/.mm` - TurboModule bridge implementation
   - Async inference with proper error handling

3. **Enum Compatibility Layer** ✅
   - Fixed `neural_engine` → `cpuAndNeuralEngine`
   - Fixed `int4` → `linear` 
   - Added mapping functions for backward compatibility

4. **Pipeline Enhancement** ✅
   - Updated fine-tuning script with INT4 quantization support
   - Core ML export with `OpLinearQuantizerConfig`
   - iOS tokenizer bundle generation

## 🔐 Special Environment Security Model

The deployment used the project's secure GitHub integration:

### 📁 Credential Isolation
- **Main `.env`**: Regular app environment variables
- **`.specialenv/.env`**: GitHub credentials (gitignored, never committed)
- **Separation**: GitHub credentials loaded only when needed

### 🛡️ Security Features
- ✅ Credentials never exposed in version control
- ✅ Automatic fallback to local-only mode when unavailable
- ✅ Secure token handling with `githubEnv` utility
- ✅ Proper gitignore configuration

### 🔑 GitHub Integration
- **Account**: ales27pm
- **Repository**: native-monGARS
- **Method**: GitHub API with Personal Access Token
- **Status**: Successfully deployed to main branch

- EventEmitter compatibility added
- Enum safety with legacy mapping
- Test expectations updated

### ✅ Native iOS Integration
- Core ML bridge fully implemented
- TurboModule specification compliant
- Async inference capability
- Error handling and fallbacks

### ✅ Development Pipeline

## 🏗️ Architecture Summary

```
PhiOnDevice System Architecture:
├── TypeScript/React Native Layer
│   ├── specs/NativePhi4LLM.ts (TurboModule interface)
│   ├── src/api/nativePhi4LLM.ts (API wrapper with enum mapping)
│   └── __tests__/ (Updated test expectations)
├── Native iOS Layer
│   ├── ios/Phi4MiniRunner.swift (Core ML runner)
│   ├── ios/RCTPhiModel.h (Bridge header)
│   └── ios/RCTPhiModel.mm (Bridge implementation)
└── Pipeline/Training
    ├── scripts/fine_tune_phi4_quebec.py (Enhanced with Core ML)
    └── Core ML export with INT4 quantization
```

---

## 🎯 Next Steps for Production Use

### 1. Model Training & Conversion
```bash
# Run the enhanced fine-tuning pipeline
cd scripts/
python fine_tune_phi4_quebec.py --convert-coreml --epochs 3
```

### 2. iOS Integration
1. Drag generated `.mlpackage` into Xcode project
2. Update iOS build settings for Swift bridging header
3. Build and test on physical iOS device (Core ML requires hardware)

### 3. Testing
- Run TypeScript tests: `bunx jest`
- Test Core ML inference on device
- Validate enum compatibility with legacy code
